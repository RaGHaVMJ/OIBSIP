			<h3>India</h3>
			<p> 
				India being part of the world’s oldest civilizations is a land of rich history, countless beliefs, traditions and legends surrounding the religions. India takes pride in the country’s rich cultural and religious history as it is the birth land of the traditions of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. India is a land where people of different religious beliefs live in harmony and brotherhood. Hinduism is believed to be the world’s oldest religion. Unlike other religions, Hinduism does not have a founder but is instead a fusion of religions. Various ancient manuscripts and scholars describe the religion as a traditional way of living, a religion whose beginning and ending cannot be traced.

				The heavenly abode of the Almighty on Earth is referred to as ‘Mandir’ by the Hindus. You will find majestic temples at mostly every corner of the country. Every temple has a unique history and legend attached to it. During the ancient times, the Indian rulers would patronize artists and sculptures for creating exceptional masterpieces in the form of temples under their reign. Tour My India introduces you to some of the most popular and magnificent temples of the country.
